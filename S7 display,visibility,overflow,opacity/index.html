           high school, Modi moved out of home in part because of Jashoda ben Chiman Lal (Modi's child marriage), that he discarded 
           and widely embraced only several years later. After moving to Gujarat, Modi traveled across India for 2 years and toured a
            number of conservative places. He became a full-time employee of the RSS in 1971. Modi was pressured to go into exile after
             the period of emergency enforced around the country in 1975.In 1985, the RSS appointed Modi into the BJP and until 2001,

              regional parliament, the Lok Sabha, for the first period since 1984 for just about any mainstream candidate. The Modi
               government has attempted to increase FDI in the Indian economy and to reduce expenditure on medical and rehabilitation 
               programs. In the bureaucratic system, Modi has helped to control productivity; he has concentrated control by dismantling 
               the Planning Department.He commenced an elevated hygienic project, started a contentious austerity measures of large-elevated

    <h2 id="Yogi1">Yogi Adityanath</h2>
    <img id="Yogi2" src="images/Yogi Adityanath.png" />
    <p id="Yogi3">
        Yogi Adityanath (birth name Ajay Mohan Bisht born in 5 June 1972) is an Indian Hindu priest and democrat who has served as Uttar Pradesh's 22nd and present CM (chief minister) since 19 March 2017.

He was announced as the Chief Minister on 26 March 2017 just after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) captured the 2017 Assembly Constituency elections, in which he was a popular activist. Through 1998, he has worked 5 successive sessions as a Parliamentarian (MP) from the Gorakhpur region, Uttar Pradesh.

Yogi Adityanath is also the Mahant or chief monk of the Gorakhnath Math, a Place of worship in Gorakhpur, a designation he held in September 2014 after the demise of his religious "father" Mahant Avaidyanath. He is also the creator of Hindu Yuva Vahini, an organization of the Hindu Nationalists. According to his divisive ideologies, he is also deemed a Hindu nationalist. He has a reputation as a gadfly of the right-wing nationalist Hinduism.

Yogi Adityanath was born in the small village of Panchur, in Pauri Garhwal, Uttar Pradesh, on 5th June 1972, named Ajay Mohan Bisht. Anand Singh Bisht, his late father, was a park ranger. He was the second of four siblings and three sisters to be raised by parents. He graduated from Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in Uttarakhand with a bachelor degree in Mathematics. He was granted with the title 'Yogi Adityanath' after taking Diksha as sanyasi of the Nath culture, and named as the descendant of the Mahant Avaidyanath. Though centered in Gorakhpur, Adityanath also traveled his home village after his induction, setting up a school there in 1998.

In 1993, at the age of 21, Adityanath relinquished his parents and then became a follower of the then holy man of Gorakhnath Math, Mahant Avaidyanath. After the demise of his mentor, Mahant Aavaidyanath, on 12 September 2014, he was elevated to the status of Mahant or Supreme Priest of Gorakhnath Math. On 14 September 2014, in the midst of sacred ceremonies of the Nath community, Yogi Adityanath was created Peethadhishwar (Chief Seer) of Math.

Linguist Christophe Jaffrelot mentions that Yogi Adityanath refers to the particular legacy in Uttar Pradesh of Hindu nationalism politics that must be linked back to Mahant Digvijay Nath, who on 22 December 1949 directed the seizure of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya for Hindus. The Mahasabha of hindus belonged to both Digvijay Nath and his predecessor, Mahant Avaidyanath, and had been appointed to Parliament on the ticket of that party. The two strands of Religious extremism raised together after the BJP (Bharatiya janta Party) and the Sangh Parivar entered in the Ayodhya agitation in the 1980s. In 1991, Avaidyanath moved to the BJP (Bharatiya Janta Party), but still retained essential independence. In 1994, Yogi Adityanath was named as the descendant of Avaidyanath as Mahant of Gorakhnath Math. After four years, he was appointed to the Indian Legislature's Lower House (the Lok Sabha).
